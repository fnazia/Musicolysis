This project tries to analyze different types of music and aims to translate the abstraction of music into interpretability.

PROJECT: KMeans Clustering of Rabindranath Tagore and Salil Chowdhury
This experiment attempts to group the music of two Bengali composers into 2 clusters. The music data is collected from [here](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~abhij/mus/index.html) in midi format. KMeans clustering technique that utilizes euclidian distance between the datapoints to create the assigned number of clusters is used.
